## Cloud UI Take Home Exercise

As the next step in the interview process, weâ€™d like you to complete a take home exercise.

Let's assume `deployments.json` is the API response you want to present to the user of a cloud service. Every day, we work with data similar to what you'll find in the provided JSON file. It consists of a list of Elasticsearch deployments. A deployment is one or more products from the Elastic Stack configured to work together, each one in its own node. Each deployment has a number of properties such as: is the deployment healthy, is its configuration currently being updated, is it a premium deployment, does it have Kibana enabled, and so on.

The task is to create a dashboard presenting the data in the provided JSON in a clear and intuitive manner that allows a user to see everything that is relevant to them, but without overwhelming them either.


You can use this project to set up the environment quickly.
We recommend spending 3-4 hours on this exercise, but if you need more time, please let us know.

You can install the project with

```
yarn
```

and start it with

```
yarn start
```
